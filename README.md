## Before start

   For working with API you will need Authorization credentials, to have able to receive Authorization token and call API methods, so you **must** be registered on the <a href ="https://kb.intermedia.net/article/63780"> Unite Extend API page </a> in **HostPilot**. Please, ask your Account Owner for help.

   More information about Authorization and needed credentials you can see <a href ="https://developer.intermedia.com/api/spec/calling/index.html#dev-guide-auth-guide">here</a>.
