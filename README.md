## Before start

   Working with the API implies having Authorization credentials for receiving Authorization token and calling API methods. Therefore, you must be registered on the <a href="https://kb.intermedia.net/article/63780"> Unite Extend API page </a> in **HostPilot**. Please, contact your Account Owner for help.

   The detailed information about Authorization and the credentials required can be found here: <a href="https://developer.intermedia.com/api/spec/calling/index.html#dev-guide-auth-guide">here</a>.

  To use samples, you need to host the repository. There are two options how to do that:

* **Option 1**: Fork the repository and [enable](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) GitHub pages on it.
* **Option 2**: Host it yourself. Clone our repository and use your favorite http server (nginx, apache, iis, etc).

Read the [article](https://kb.intermedia.net/article/63780) to learn about the correct creation of clients for proper authorization flow initiation.
Once you have done this, you can start using the samples.
